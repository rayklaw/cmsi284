| | Feedback | Points |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| _Madlib_ | **Compiles and runs without unexpected errors** | |
| | Compiles and runs successfully | 5 |
| | **Correct functionality** | |
| | Correct behavior except for extraneous print; student and internal tests pass; premature `free` (`free` must happen only after use—in this case, after the tests) | 17 |
| | **Adequate test cases** | |
| | Adequate test coverage; `madlib` return value is not `free`d but you probably thought that the premature `free` was sufficient | 5 |
| _Madlib-by-Numbers_ | **Compiles and runs without unexpected errors** | |
| | Compiles and runs successfully | 5 |
| | **Correct functionality** | |
| | Premature `free` (`free` must happen only after use—in this case, after the tests) | 12 |
| | **Adequate test cases** | |
| | Adequate test coverage; `madlib_by_numbers` return value is not `free`d but you probably thought that the premature `free` was sufficient | 10 |
| _Reverse Words_ | **Compiles and runs without unexpected errors** | |
| | Compiles and runs successfully | 5 |
| | **Correct functionality** | |
| | Correct behavior; student (after manual fixing of student test bus error) and internal tests pass | 20 |
| | **Adequate test cases** | |
| | Student tests originally incurred bus error due to incorrect assignment/handling of string literals | 5 |
| | **Missing test program** | |
